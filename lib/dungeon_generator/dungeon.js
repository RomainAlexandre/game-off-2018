// TODO Create a Dungeon generator following our own rules.
/*

Few Ideas unordered:

1) A dungeon should always generate rooms of the same size per type of room.
A room could be of type:
- Small
- Large (double size width or height of a small one)

It will allow us to create some design for the rooms inside TILED.

2) A dungeon should always have these types of rooms:
- Treasure Room (Give you one (maybe more) random card from you pool of available card)
- Boss Room (A fight more difficult than regular fight)
- Shop Room (Nice to have. Allow you to by bonus card or stuff like that)
It could generate rooms like:
- A vault room (Full of money that could be used in the shop or used after the player died to unlock new cards)
- Library Room (Give you the possibility to pick 1 card between 3 cards)

3) Each room should have their own set of rules.
eg:
- A boss Room is the last room of the floor.
- A special room is connected to only one normal room
